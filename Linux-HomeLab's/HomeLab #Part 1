# ðŸ§ª Linux Lab Report: User, Group, and SSH Access Management

## 1. What I Learned

- How to **create users and groups** in Linux.
- How to **assign users to groups**.
- How to **set passwords** and grant **sudo access**.
- How to **restrict SSH access** to specific users via `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
- How to troubleshoot SSH access issues by restarting services and monitoring logs.

---

## 2. Questions I Had

- How do I **safely edit SSH access** without locking myself out?
- Whatâ€™s the correct **syntax in `sshd_config`** for allowing or denying specific users?
- How do I **restart the SSH service** and make sure changes are live?

---

## 3. How Things Connected

- `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` hold the system's user and group records.
- SSH uses `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to determine **who can log in** remotely.
- Restarting SSH with `systemctl restart sshd` is **critical** after modifying config files.
- Logs in `/var/log/secure` show **login attempts and errors**, which helped validate changes.

## 4. What I Tried / Commands Used

 # Step 1. Create group and user

COMMAND(for group): sudo groupadd devops_team
COMMAND(for user): sudo useradd -m -G devops_team devops_user

# Step 2. Set password for the new user

COMMAND: sudo passwd devops_user

# Step 3. Grant sudo access (method depends on distro, assuming CentOS/RHEL)

COMMAND: sudo usermod -aG wheel devops_user

# Step 4. Restrict SSH access in sshd_config

COMMAND: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Add or modify:

AllowUsers your_admin_user devops_user

# Step 5. Restart SSH service

COMMAND: sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Step 6. Verfied if it worked

COMMAND: sudo tail -f /var/log/secure 

## 5. Where I got stuck: SSH Access Restricitons

# The Problem: 

- I didn't know where or how to allow SSH access for specific users. I was unsure what to add or change in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# How I Fixed it: 

- Using the command on step 4 to gain access

- COMMAND: AllowUsers your_admin_user devops_user

- Saved, Exit & Excute command: CTRL + O -> ENTER -> CTRL + X

## 6. Real-World Application/Use Case 

- Managing access control, enforcing least privilege, and auditing logins are key for securing servers. 

- You'll often need to automate user creation, SSH Rules, & group policies in production systems or Sys Admin/DevOps pipelines.

- This skill is useful in cloud environments, especially when setting up bastion hosts, jump servers, and identity-based access.
