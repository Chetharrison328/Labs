#   Lesson 3: Homelab #2 â€“ Creating & Managing Organizational Units (OUs)

## 1. What I Learned

- How to create Organizational Units (OUs) in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).
- The difference between **containers** and **OUs** â€” GPOs can only be applied to OUs.
- Importance of grouping objects logically (e.g., by department) to streamline permissions and Group Policy.
- How to move users into appropriate OUs for better access management and delegation.
- Understood why at least **two domain controllers** are recommended for availability.

## 2. Questions I Had

- How do I correctly set a static IP address before promoting the server to a domain controller?
- What steps did I miss that caused me to struggle with assigning permissions to newly created users?
- Whatâ€™s the best naming convention for OUs in an enterprise-level environment?

## 3. How Things Connected

- The OU structure is directly tied to **delegation of control** and **GPO targeting**, which I learned more about in Lesson 4.
- This homelab reflected what I do at work physically â€” managing access and organizing identity â€” but now on the IT/virtual side.
- Realized how default containers (like "Users") are less flexible since GPOs canâ€™t be applied to them â€” so OUs are essential.

## 4. What I Needed to Try Next

- Practice assigning **delegated permissions** on the OUs using the **Delegation of Control Wizard**.
- Try setting up a **nested OU** (e.g., IT â†’ Helpdesk) and moving users between levels.
- Fix the initial AD DS misconfiguration by learning:
  - How to properly assign static IP addresses via Network Adapter settings.
  - How to properly create a new forest/domain during the `AD DS` role configuration.

## 5. Real-World Application / Use Case

- In a real enterprise, OUs allow large organizations to manage users and devices by department or location.
- Admins use OUs to assign different GPOs to HR vs IT vs Contractors â€” just like I set up in this lab.
- This is the foundation for **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** in Microsoft environments â€” perfect for the career path I'm pursuing.

###   Troubleshooting I Encountered

- Forgot to set a static IP on the VM before promoting to a domain controller.
- Had to manually assign IP â†’ then re-add the AD DS role and configure the domain properly.
- Forgot some of the initial domain setup steps (e.g., creating the forest, making sure admin account had correct privileges).
