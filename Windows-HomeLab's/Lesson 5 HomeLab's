#   Lesson 5 – Homelab #5: Delegation, RSAT Tools, and PowerShell

##   What I Learned

### Part 1: Delegated Password Reset
- Successfully delegated password reset permissions to the `TechSupport1` user.
- Confirmed that the user was able to reset passwords for other users within the allowed OU.

### Part 2: RSAT Tool Usage
- **Group Policy Management**: Used to create and edit GPOs.
- **ADSI Edit**: Used to access low-level AD object properties and manage AD schema.
- **DNS Manager**: Used to view domain name and IP address mappings.

### Part 3: PowerShell Exploration
- Checked AD user info (initial issue caused by typo in username).
- Viewed Event Logs using `Get-EventLog`.
- Ran `Test-Connection` to verify network connectivity (received 4 successful responses).
- Used `Get-Service` to see running services.
- Used `Get-Help`, but needed to run `Update-Help` first to access full documentation.

##   Questions I Had
- Why wasn’t my user showing up initially in ADUC? (Turns out I typed the name slightly wrong.)
- Do user property configurations in ADUC impact delegation success?

---

##   How Things Connected
- This lab tied back to the **least privilege** concept from Lesson 5.
- Showed how RSAT tools and PowerShell support remote and flexible AD management.
- Reinforced the relationship between GUI tools and command-line tools in enterprise environments.

---

##   What I Needed to Try Next
- Practice writing PowerShell scripts for AD user tasks.
- Explore more advanced GPO settings and how they impact user access.
- Revisit user object properties in ADUC for deeper customization.

##   Real-World Application / Use Case
- Use delegation to allow help desk users limited admin privileges for password resets.
- RSAT enables IT admins to manage domain services remotely and securely.
- PowerShell is critical for automation, bulk operations, and advanced diagnostics in a real network.
