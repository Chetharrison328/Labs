#   Windows Server 2022 - Mini Labs (1‚Äì4)

##   What I Learned

### Lab 1: Clean Install + VM Creation (Server Core vs. Desktop Experience)
- Learned how to create and clean install VMs using both:
  - **Server Core**
  - **Desktop Experience**
- Server Core crashed the first time with an error ("Operating system not found").
  - Reinstalling worked the second time and installed faster than Desktop.
- Had to change the admin password in the terminal during first login.
- Desktop Experience gave me no issues when installing. 
- Noted that:
  - **Server Core** has a terminal-only interface with numbered options (e.g., #7 shows Remote Desktop status).
  - **Desktop Experience** offers a clean Windows GUI.
- Struggled with understanding the real-world use cases and benefits of Core vs. Desktop installs.

### Lab 2: VM Settings (System, Network, Processor)
- Modified VM settings:
  - System memory
  - Number of processors
  - Network adapter
- Restarted VM and booted successfully.
- Observed no issues during boot.
- Verified VM had internet access.
- Didn't struggle with this lab ‚Äî wanted to see how changes affected boot behavior.

### Lab 3: Clean Install vs. In-Place Upgrade
- Revisited clean install steps.
- Saved in-place upgrade for later hands-on practice.
- Researched in-place upgrades:
  - Allows OS upgrade without wiping data or roles.
  - Avoided in most orgs due to:
    - Risk of corruptions
    - Compatibility issues
- Clean installs are preferred for stability and control.

### Lab 4: Azure Extended Network (Theory)
- No Azure account, so no hands-on for this lab.
- Researched:
  - **Azure Extended Network**: lets on-prem VMs keep their IPs when migrated to Azure.
  - Configuration options:
    - On-prem subnet extension
    - Firewall setup for asymmetric routing
    - Hybrid deployments
- Learned deployment, management, and troubleshooting concepts from reading.

---

##    Questions I Had
- Why is Server Core the preferred choice in some enterprise environments?
- When is an in-place upgrade acceptable in a production setting?
- How do orgs properly test in-place upgrades before going live?

---

## üîÅ What I Need to Try Next
- Retry Server Core install to resolve crash issue if it happens again.
- Attempt an in-place upgrade from Windows Server 2016 or 2019 to 2022.
- Set up a free Azure account to practice hybrid network extension labs.

## üõ°Ô∏è Real-World Relevance
These labs simulate basic tasks a Windows Admin or IAM-focused professional may perform:
- Deploying and configuring servers for Active Directory or DNS/DHCP roles.
- Choosing between GUI and non-GUI installs for security and performance.
- Understanding hybrid networking strategies used in cloud IAM setups.
