##  Lesson 4 – Homelab #3: Creating and Linking GPOs

---

### 1. What I Learned

- I created a Group Policy Object named `HR_PasswordPolicy`.
- I used **Computer Configuration** → **Windows Settings** → **Security Settings** → **Account Policies** → **Password Policy** to edit the GPO.
- I learned how to link a GPO to a specific Organizational Unit (OU).
- I used `gpupdate /force` to apply the GPO and `gpresult /r` to verify it was working.

---

### 2. Questions I Had

- I wasn’t sure if I was clicking the right sections under "Computer Configuration" at first — the layout was a little confusing.
- Do all GPOs need to be enforced to work reliably, or is linking usually enough?

---

### 3. How Things Connected

- This lab reinforced the GPO structure I studied in Lesson 4 — local, site, domain, and OU-level GPOs.
- It also gave me practical experience using **GPMC**, which ties into access and privilege management from Lesson 5.
- Running `gpresult /r` reminded me of using command-line tools to validate system state, just like I practiced in Lesson 1 with `ipconfig`.

---

### 4. What I Need to Try Next

- Go back and try from the lab to test:
  - **Blocking inheritance** on an OU
  - **Enforcing** a GPO from the domain level
- Try creating another GPO for a different OU (like `IT`) using **User Configuration** instead.

### 5. Real-World Application / Use Case

- In a real organization, this is exactly how an IT team would push security policies across departments — like password length or expiration rules for HR employees.
- Understanding how to link and verify GPOs is a foundational skill for Windows Server admins and IAM professionals.
- This same knowledge would be used in roles managing access controls, workstation security, or compliance enforcement.
